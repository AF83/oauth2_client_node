  oauth2_client_node is a node library providing the bases to implement an OAuth2 client. It features a [connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) middleware to ease the integration with any other components.

It implements the OAuth2 [web server schema](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-10#section-1.4.1) as specified by the [draft 10 of the OAuth2 specification](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-10).

This project will follow the specification evolutions, so a branch for the [draft 11](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-11) will soon be created.
