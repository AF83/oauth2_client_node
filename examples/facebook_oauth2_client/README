To run this example:

- Starts the server (Oauth2 client server):

    node server.js


- Go to http://127.0.0.1:7070/ and try to log in with one of your FB account(s)


NOTE: 22/12/2010, it seems this example no longer works, due to an error
(or else?) from facebook redirecting the user to 127.facebook.com and not 127.0.0.1.
